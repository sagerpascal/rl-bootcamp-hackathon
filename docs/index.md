# About this Page
In my master studies I am taking the course EVA-MI_Lab. In this course we learn the basics and also some advanced concepts about Reinforcment Learning. Instead of an exam, we get graded by the results of a three-day hackathon. I have documented my results on this page. Since the focus was mainly on the implementation, I could only put the minimal amount of effort into this page. So sorry for any design issues or spelling mistakes :).
